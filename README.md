WMAP's baby picture of the Universe
This image is a baby picture of the universe, showing the magnitude and distribution of overdense and underdense regions that grew into galaxies, clusters, and great cosmic voids. It revealed the picture of our Universe as being a mix of dark matter, normal matter, and dark energy, changing our perception of the Universe as we know it.

Hubble's Pillars of Creation image
This image is of the Eagle Nebula and shows columns of gas amid the stars that contain proto-stars still in the process of forming. These columns are being evaporated from both the inside and the outside, thanks to the ultraviolet light emitted from the hot, young stars that have just been created.
