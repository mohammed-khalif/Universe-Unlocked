        "description": "The Extreme Deep Field (XDF) of the Universe is the greatest view ever taken, comprising a total of 23 days of observing time in an area of space that's just 1/32,000,000th of the entire sky. They didn't just find over five thousand galaxies, but incredible examples of galaxy evolution, as it was able to see back to times where the Universe was just 4% of its current age. We've learned how our Universe has grown up and how galaxies have gone from tiny seeds of structure to the modern behemoths we have today. Most spectacularly, we've been able to make our first accurate estimate of the total number of galaxies within our observable Universe: two trillion. Remarkably, all that information is encoded in one single image..",

        "description": " Anything youve ever learned, seen, or experienced from NASA has been a result of education and public outreach. The above photo? It’s known simply as “Earthrise,” and was the first time a human being had ever seen the Earth rise over the limb of the Moon. Taken by astronaut Bill Anders as Apollo 8 completed its final pass around the far side of the Moon, it showed humanity, for the first time, how special and precious and tiny and fragile Earth is. Anders, who took the photo, said the followingWe came all this way to explore the Moon, and the most important thing is that we discovered the Earth.",

        "description": "These regions grew into galaxies, clusters, and great cosmic voids, but it was the baby picture of WMAP that first revealed the details of the Universe to such a precise degree. The magnitude and distribution of these overdense and underdense regions show up as temperature fluctuations in the CMB, teaching us what our Universe is made of. The picture of our Universe as being a mix of dark matter, normal matter, and dark energy was first precisely revealed by WMAP, changing our perception of the Universe as we know it.",

        "description": " On February 14, 1990, after more than a decade of traveling away from Earth and on its way out of the Solar System, the Voyager 1 spacecraft turned its eye back towards home. Looking back at its journey, it was able to take snapshots of six planets, including the above image of Earth, from six billion kilometers away, making this the most distant photo of Earth ever taken.Voyager 1 is now some 20 billion kilometers distant, as it continues its journey into interstellar space as the most distant spacecraft from Earth.",

        "description": "Many of the nebulae visible, both in our own galaxy and beyond, are star-forming regions, where cool molecular gas contracts under the influence of gravitation to form new stars deep inside their collapsed hearts. In 1995, for the very first time, we were able to peer deep inside the heart of one such region, the Eagle Nebula, and discover columns of gas amid the stars. These columns contain proto-stars still in the process of forming, and are being evaporated from both the inside and the outside, thanks to the ultraviolet light emitted from the hot, young stars that have just been created.In other words, the pillars of creation are also pillars of destruction. Infrared and X-ray light reveals the stars inside, while a higher-resolution, updated version released 20 years later showcased the slow evaporation and changes taking place inside the pillars. In a few hundred thousand to a few million years, they'll have evaporated entirely..",
